    <p>
      This classic lasagna recipe is made with an easy meat sauce as the base.
      Layer the sauce with noodles and cheese, then bake until bubbly! This is
      great for feeding a big family and freezes well, too.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Milk</li>
      <li>Cheese</li>
      <li>Tomato Paste</li>
      <li>Meat</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        2 x 28 oz. cans tomatoes - crushed or whole is best! If you get whole
        canned tomatoes just crush them in your hands.
      </li>

      <li>1 pound ground beef, preferably lean</li>

      <li>
        Once they're done, rinse them with cold water using a colander and set
        them aside. Try to separate them a bit so they stick less later.
      </li>
    </ol>
